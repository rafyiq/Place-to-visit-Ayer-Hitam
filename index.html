	<p>Ayer Hitam[1] simply means Black Water. A lively town, Ayer Hitam is always bustling with passing vehicles and people who travels north and south. <strong>This place is well known for its ceramic items such as flower vases in an assortment of colours, photo frames, jars, ashtrays, and other home decorative items.</strong> For a closer look, you can also watch the potters at work. Aside from quality souvenirs, Ayer Hitam is also dotted with many stalls selling local tidbits known as 'kerepek' among the locals. Amongst the famous ones are prawn crackers, steamed corn, tapioca chips, and the all-time must-try "otak-otak". These food items are fresh and prepacked for you, and sold at reasonable prices.</p>

	<p>Located in the district of Batu Pahat. Before the advent of the Northâ€“South Expressway, Air Hitam was a major route intersection leading to Melaka and Kuala Lumpur going northbound, Johor Bahru going southbound, and Kluang and Mersing going eastbound. <em>It was a popular rest stop for many tour buses and travellers between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.</em> Visitors could find souvenir shops, restaurants and locals peddling to sell their vegetables.</p>
